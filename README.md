Here are some of my projects I am working on during my spare time. 

# Br√∂llopsjakten (The Wedding Hunt)
This is a little game demo I developed for android, as a wedding gift to my brother. It is still a work in progress but this is the demo. I have done all coding, and my boyfriend was responsible for the graphics.
